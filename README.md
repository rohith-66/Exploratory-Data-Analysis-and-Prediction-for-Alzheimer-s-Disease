# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-and-Prediction-for-Alzheimer-s-Disease
Using pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn, this project explores Alzheimer's Disease data with EDA techniques and builds predictive models like Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors.


This repository contains code for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and prediction models for Alzheimer's Disease using machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.
